## How to run locally

In order to run locally, you must have `Node.js` installed, which comes with Node Package Manager (`npm`).

Install Node.js here: https://nodejs.org/en/


1. From within the root of the project directory, type `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Run `npm run dev` to run the development server
3. Open the server at `localhost:3000`
4. Make changes and enjoy hot-reloading (instant changes etc)
